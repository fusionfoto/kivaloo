dynamodb-kv design
==================

The kivaloo dynamodb-kv daemon is invoked as

# dynamodb-kv -s <dynamodb-kv socket> -r <DynamoDB region>
      -t <DynamoDB table> -k <keyfile> [-1] [-l <logfile>] [-p <pidfile>]
      [--rate <writes>:<reads>]

It creates a socket <dynamodb-kv socket> on which it listens for incoming
connections and accepts one at a time.  It reads keys from the file <keyfile>,
which must have lines ACCESS_KEY_ID=<keyid> and ACCESS_KEY_SECRET=<secret>,
and uses these to make requests to the specified DynamoDB table / region.

The other options are:
  -1
	Exit after handling one connection.
  -l <logfile>
	Log DynamoDB requests to <logfile>.
  -p <pidfile>
	Write the daemon's process ID to the file <pidfile>.  Defaults to
	-p <dynamodb-kv socket>.pid.  (Note that if <dynamodb-kv socket> is
	not an absolute path, the default pid file location is in the current
	directory.)
  --rate <writes>:<reads>
	When throttling requests, issue the specified number of writes and
	reads per second.  Note that these values are NOT DynamoDB capacity
	units.  Default: --rate 5:5.

Code structure
--------------

main.c		-- Processes command line, starts DNS lookups, creates
		   request queues for reads and writes, creates a listening
		   socket, daemonizes, accepts one connection at once, and
		   runs the event loop.
dispatch.c	-- Reads requests from a connection and drops the connection
		   if one cannot be read.
